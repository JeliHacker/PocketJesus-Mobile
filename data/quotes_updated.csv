"
"60","Matthew 6:9","
Pray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.

But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;

"
"69","Matthew 6:18","
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.

"
"70","Matthew 6:19","
“Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;

"
"71","Matthew 6:20","

“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon.

"
"76","Matthew 6:25","
Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothing?

"
"77","Matthew 6:26","
See the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you of much more value than they?

“Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment
to his lifespan?

"
"79","Matthew 6:28","
Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin,

"
"80","Matthew 6:29","
yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.

"
"81","Matthew 6:30","
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
"
"82","Matthew 6:31","
“Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’

"
"83","Matthew 6:32","
For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

"
"84","Matthew 6:33","
But seek first God’s Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.

"
"85","Matthew 6:34","
Therefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day’s own evil is sufficient.
"
"86","Matthew 7:1","
“Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged.

"
"87","Matthew 7:2","
For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.

"
"88","Matthew 7:3","
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?

"
"89","Matthew 7:4","
Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye;’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye?

"
"90","Matthew 7:5","
You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.
"
"91","Matthew 7:6","
“Don’t give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
"
"92","Matthew 7:7","
“Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.

"
"93","Matthew 7:8","
For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.

"
"94","Matthew 7:9","
Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?

"
"95","Matthew 7:10","
Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?

"
"96","Matthew 7:11","
If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!

"
"97","Matthew 7:12","
Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
"
"98","Matthew 7:13","
“Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.

"
"99","Matthew 7:14","
How
narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.
"
"100","Matthew 7:15","
“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.

"
"101","Matthew 7:16","
By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?

"
"102","Matthew 7:17","
Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.

"
"103","Matthew 7:18","
A good tree can’t produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.

"
"104","Matthew 7:19","
Every tree that doesn’t grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.

"
"105","Matthew 7:20","
Therefore by their fruits you will know them.

"
"106","Matthew 7:21","
Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

"
"107","Matthew 7:22","
Many will tell me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?’

"
"108","Matthew 7:23","
Then I will tell them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.’
"
"109","Matthew 7:24","
“Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.

"
"110","Matthew 7:25","
The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock.

"
"111","Matthew 7:26","
Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn’t do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.

"
"112","Matthew 7:27","
The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.”
"
"113","Matthew 8:3","Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying,
“I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
"
"114","Matthew 8:4","Jesus said to him,
“See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
"
"115","Matthew 8:7","Jesus said to him,
“I will come and heal him.”
"
"116","Matthew 8:10","When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed,
“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel.

"
"117","Matthew 8:11","
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,

"
"118","Matthew 8:12","
but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
"
"119","Matthew 8:13","Jesus said to the centurion,
“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour.
"
"120","Matthew 8:20","Jesus said to him,
“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
"
"121","Matthew 8:22","But Jesus said to him,
“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
"
"122","Matthew 8:26","He said to them,
“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”
 Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
"
"123","Matthew 8:32","He said to them,
“Go!”
They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
"
"124","Matthew 9:2","Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic,
“Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you.”
"
"125","Matthew 9:4","Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said,
“Why do you think evil in your hearts?

"
"126","Matthew 9:5","
For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’

"
"127","Matthew 9:6","
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins-” (then he said to the paralytic),
“Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.”
"
"128","Matthew 9:9","As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him,
“Follow me.” He got up and followed him.
"
"129","Matthew 9:12","When Jesus heard it, he said to them,
“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.

"
"130","Matthew 9:13","
But you go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’

"131","Matthew 9:15","Jesus said to them,
“Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.

No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.

Neither do people put new wine into old wine skins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.”

“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”
They told him, “Yes, Lord.”

“According to your faith be it done to you.”
